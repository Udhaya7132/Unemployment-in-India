#Unemployment Data Analysis
Overview
This repository contains Python code and data analysis notebooks that explore and visualize unemployment data. The dataset used provides insights into unemployment rates, labor participation rates, and employment figures across various regions and states. The analysis conducted here encompasses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates, regional variations, and more.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced  and contains detailed information about unemployment rates and related metrics up to November 2020. It includes data on regions, states, months, and various employment-related metrics.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
In this section, we cleaned and preprocessed the data to make it suitable for analysis. Steps included handling missing values, renaming columns, and converting data types where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
We conducted an exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights into the dataset. This involved statistical summaries, correlation analysis, and data distribution exploration.

Visualizations:
We created various visualizations to better understand the data. These visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.

Impact of Lockdown:
One of the key aspects of this analysis is the assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates. We compared unemployment rates before and after the pandemic and visualized the percentage change in unemployment for different states.

Conclusion:
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of unemployment data, with a focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The code and notebooks can be used as a reference for similar data analysis projects or as a basis for further research.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and visualizations to gain insights into unemployment trends and regional variations.
